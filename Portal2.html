    <p>Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle platformer by Valve. The game takes place in Aperture Laboratories, where the character Chell has been kept for a long time. After her container room crashes the player needs to navigate through the laboratory chambers to escape the facility.</p>
    <p>The player uses a portal gun, which can fire two portals onto surfaces painted with moon rock-infused paint. In addition the player can use different gels that help them jump or run much better. The test chambers are run by an AI called GLaDOS, who is conducting experiments with Chell and hoping to kill her in the process.</p>
    <p>Portal 2 has also a two-player campaign where the players must co-operate to solve puzzles with their portal guns.</p>
